The analysis of credit card customer data reveals clear patterns in revenue generation, customer demographics, spending behavior, and geographic trends. Revenue is predominantly driven by customers aged 30–50, female customers, and those with graduate or higher education. Married, high-income, and business professionals form the most valuable segments. Geographically, Texas, New York, and California dominate revenue contribution. High-tier cards such as Gold and Platinum yield strong returns, with chip and swipe transactions being most common. Customers with no dependents tend to spend more.
